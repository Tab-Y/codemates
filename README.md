# Codemates

## Description 

Our motivation for creating this project was to showcase our programming skills throughout the bootcamp and use what we learned to create a fully functional real-world application. In th eprocess of creating this application we have better learned how to use all the technologies and skills provided to us and also learned how to piece them all together into a functional full stack application.
